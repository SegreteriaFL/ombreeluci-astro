G
ood afternoon, my dear readers. I left you with the
[previous piece](https://www.ombreeluci.it/2025/alla-piccola-marcia-di-assisi/)
about the Little March, but as you know, I’m a bit of a wanderer! So after the Little March, I went to a farmhouse near Viterbo, where we had
**our camp from July 30 to September 6**
. Nicknamed “Bicoca 2,” it was a wonderful camp, because there were quite a few young people. There was a real desire to learn and to grow together. Over the years, I can truly say that Fede e Luce has made great progress with young people, organizing training courses and inviting new friends to join the communities. The camp was well organized, but given how many of us there were, let’s just say we had to squeeze in a bit! But friendship, joy, and fun were always there. To me, Bicoca 2 brings something truly special to Fede e Luce, because there are very few young people today who are so sensitive, so eager to give and to help in our society. And if we consider that many of them come from families who first met through Fede e Luce years ago, it’s really
**a bond that keeps growing stronger and stronger**
. That gives us courage and the will to keep raising awareness in society — and I’m so glad about that (I told you in the last circle that this piece would be dedicated to you, because that’s only right, it truly is!). The theme of the camp was “Disney, My Way!” because we chose different Disney movies and reflected on their themes day by day. For example, we talked about Stitch, a cartoon about an alien looking for a new family. He comes from another world and meets two sisters — well, it’s a bit like us at Fede e Luce, isn’t it?
**We’re all different, we come from different places, each with our own ways and challenges.**
Stitch and the other Disney characters made this camp unique in their own way. Even though we already knew how those stories ended, the days we spent together at camp were the ones we wrote ourselves, day after day. Well, my friends, what can I say? For those who read my blog and don’t yet know what our camps are, I can only invite you to come and see for yourselves what Fede e Luce really is, beyond our usual meeting places. But above all, I want to share this positive message: keep supporting new projects, keep organizing new things — and I’m especially speaking to the young people here, because between school and university, spreading the word about Fede e Luce by word of mouth might just help us go a little further!
**So that’s what I experienced, and I’ll leave you with that feeling.**
Soon I’ll tell you all about the trip to Pompei. See you next time! https://youtu.be/gd2iT1xJRxE
