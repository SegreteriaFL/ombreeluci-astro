*New forms of poverty have been always on the horizon and in this moment, we cannot help but see a new category of poverty, the last ones: the refugees. The situation of fleeing war zones and those who leave their homes and country to seek a better life, but still want to have a normal life, appears extremely dramatic. Moreover, in no longer thriving social contexts, the only answer seems to be solely economic: which is what we cannot afford! And so, a position of defense when there is no attack, is taken towards these people who place their hope and survival in nearby Europe.*

***Whatever our political position is in the face of this phenomenon, it constitutes a problem for Italy and Europe, and likewise it is a tragedy for those experiencing it.** Whatever our degree of intolerance or empathy for these people, it is still a problem to which we cannot in any ways close our eyes.*

*We must ask ourselves: **what can we do better?** And, as Christians: what can I do? There are no easy answers, but we can get to know the situation better and also ask ourselves: where are the people with disabilities in all this? Are they able to get away with their families? How do they cope with all these large difficulties?*

***We asked a few questions to Anna Marchei, a reference for the Community of Sant’Egidio for the humanitarian corridors** .*

**Can you explain to us better how the humanitarian corridors work, how long they have been in place, if in addition to Sant ’Egidio, are there other organizations that deal with these issues?**

The Humanitarian Corridors project is the result of an agreement between the Government, the [Community of Sant ‘Egidio](https://www.santegidio.org) , the [Federation of Evangelical churches in Italy](https://www.fcei.it/) and the [Tavola Valdese](https://www.chiesavaldese.org) , it envisages the regular arrival over two years of a thousand people in Italy from Lebanon (in particular Syrians and Iraqis), from Morocco (where refugees from sub-Saharan countries gather) and from Ethiopia (where Eritreans, Somalis and Sudanese land).

The memorandum of agreement was signed in December 2016, after a year of negotiations. The first family entered on 04/02/2017. To date, around 800 refugees from Lebanon have arrived from Italy, mostly single women, families, the elderly, the sick, fragile people in vulnerable conditions.

Totally self-funded, thanks to 8x100 of the Church Valdese and other fundraisers, the project aims to reduce deaths and shipwrecks along the Mediterranean routes and allow people in need, in vulnerable conditions, to access the system of international protection through legal entry into the national territory.

Other objectives of the project:

- Experiment a good practice that can be replicated in other European contexts (the Republic of San Marino has welcomed a family since last June; France has signed a similar agreement for 500 entries with the same actors involved in Italy; the Polish Episcopal Conference has announced similar initiative and Germany and Spain have also expressed their favor towards the Humanitarian Corridors). - Experiment with the possibility of reintroducing the sponsor system into Italian legislation and prospectively introducing it in Europe as is already the case in other continents (Canada, United States, etc.) and as it has been implemented in the last two years in Germany.

It differs from projects of Resettlement in that it considers specific individual situations that would be easy victims of human trafficking: single women with children, victims of trafficking, the elderly, people with disabilities or serious pathologies. It could also allow legal access to Europe for displaced persons in clear need of international protection and may include people recognized as refugees by the UNHCR; moreover, it does not limit itself to allowing legal entry but puts in place a series of social, cultural, and linguistic activities that facilitate social inclusion.

**Can you explain to us how the various steps take place: notification, selection, place of destination, reception in Italy or in other countries?** The reports come from associations, entities operating in the area, local religious realities or self-reports. Refugees are met several times to learn about the situation and evaluate the most suitable reception path.

The beneficiaries can be:

- - Persons recognized by UNHCR as refugees; - People who show a proven condition of vulnerability determined by their personal situation; - Persons who may benefit in Italy from support due to the declared willingness of individuals, churches or associations to initially provide for their hospitality and sustenance; - People who have stable family or social networks in Italy.

The receptions process is stated from these criteria:

- - A list is drawn up, prepared through direct contacts of the associations with the potential beneficiaries on site through reports provided by local actors present in the countries involved (Churches, associations, international organizations, movements, etc.). Each report will be verified by the people of the associations and then by the Italian authorities; - The list is sent to the Italian consular authorities in the countries involved for verification and control by the Ministry of the Interior; - Entry visas are issued pursuant to the Visa Regulation (EC) art.25, i.e. Visas with Limited Territorial Validity which are provided when, for humanitarian reasons or national interest or by the virtue of international obligations, the Member State concerned deems it necessary to issue them.

**Can disability constitute an element of preference or, conversely, an obstacle?** Disability is one of the preference criteria. The first to arrive in Italy was Falak with her little brother and parents. A little girl who risked losing her sight from a tumor and was in urgent need of the treatments that she could not have in Lebanon.

**In your opinion, could humanitarian corridors be a valid alternative to uncontrolled and risky landings for people’s lives? In other words, could they also be suitable for large numbers?** The main objective of this project is to avoid trafficking in human beings, to avoid deaths at sea, and to show that it is possible to use other entry channels than the ways of the death boats. It is a pilot project to show that using the legislative instruments already available to the European Union, without affecting the political asylum system, it is possible to let people in regularly. It is therefore a project that can be replicated in other countries together with civil society.

**Among those who continue to land in Italy with the infamous “barges” or in any case with makeshift means, are there people with disabilities?** In fact, there are cases of people with disabilities who rely on real means of luck, but these journeys are extremely dangerous and risky for them. Ruba’s family could hardly have arrived in Europe from Syria. She is missing an arm and her husband, due to the results of severe polio, is in a wheelchair, they have a nine-year-old boy who they would no longer be able to provide for in that situation. They have arrived in Italy with the second trip of humanitarian corridors and are finally organizing a normal life without the constant nightmare of bombs.

Rasha is one of 93 refugees that the humanitarian corridors brought from Lebanon to Rome. He lived in Yarmouk, the largest Palestinian camp in Syria. Rasha, whose husband had died in the bombings, is in danger of losing her sight completely due to a bomb that hit her on the street. Her brothers, who has already left on the boats, could not help her because they had to repay the debts incurred for their journey. Until the Italian NGO signals her for the humanitarian corridor and so she was able to cross the Mediterranean by plane. She and her children will be hosted in a reception facility by the missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit with the contribution of Sant’Egidio. A real home and a school for the children.
