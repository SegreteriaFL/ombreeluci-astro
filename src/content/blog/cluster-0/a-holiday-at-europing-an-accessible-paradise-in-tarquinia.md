M
y dear readers, good afternoon. Last time I wrote about the charity race. Today I want to tell you about a short holiday I took with Rita and Paola, from July 6 to July 13, in a wonderful campsite.
**A place I highly recommend because, unlike many others, it is fully equipped for people with disabilities.**
It’s also perfect for all ages, since there are so many activities to choose from: the woods, the swimming pool, and the sea. The campsite is called
**Europing**
and it’s located in Tarquinia. It was a rewarding and joyful week, and I’m happy to try new places so I can recommend them to you and share some tips. To book a bungalow, you’ll need to leave a €100 deposit, which the campsite keeps until check-out as insurance in case of damage. At check-in, you’ll receive a red wristband to access the swimming pool. The bungalows are arranged with one bedroom and a bathroom. Outside there’s a small veranda with a kitchen. Not all of them are fully renovated yet, but I still recommend it because during that week I had a great time.
**We really did everything!**
If you’re looking for a place to go on holiday with your children — even those with a bit of a strong character — this wonderful spot offers plenty of activities to choose from: by the sea, in the pool, or in the woods.
**A big thank-you to Rita and to my roommate, with whom I laughed endlessly.**
I wanted to share this place with you because I enjoy exploring on your behalf, and I believe it’s important to tell you when I discover a relaxing, well-equipped destination for us and for those who accompany us. After all, that’s exactly why this blog was born! Next time, I’ll tell you about the Little Franciscan March, and I invite you to follow me because there are big news ahead!
