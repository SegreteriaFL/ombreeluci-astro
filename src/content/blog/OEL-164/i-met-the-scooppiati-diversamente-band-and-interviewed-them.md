Today I’m accompanied by a musician, Daniele Ponziani, who has accepted to do an interview from me. Daniele is part of the group [**Scooppiati – diversamente band**](https://www.scooppiati.it/) , a band active since 2012, formed by people with disabilities. Their last single, *Un istante, came out last march, and tells of the terrible scenarios of war.*

**Hi Daniele, thanks for accepting this interview. Tell us a little about who you are.** Thank you Antonietta. I’m part of the group Scooppiati, I’m the drummer. The group was formed through a cooperative called H Anno Zero, a cooperative dedicated to people with disabilities.

**So in your band, it’s not only you with a disability, I imagine…** Absolutely not. My band was formed from a drummer, me, who’s blind. Then there’s the keyboardist named **Giammario Mascolo,** he’s also blind. We have the singer who’s in a wheelchair, named **Ketty Giansiracusa;** the bassist is **Peppe Salis,** and the guitarist **Andrea Curatolo.**

**This is the lineup of your band called…** Scooppiati diversamente band!

**Why did you choose this name?** The name is a mix between “scoppiati” and “cooperative”, referring precisely to [**Cooperativa H Anno Zero**](https://www.h-annozero.it/) , which has two o’s. Don`t forget, also “Scooppiati” has two o’s!

**But now do you still go to this cooperative where the band was started or not?** Before I volunteered there, but now they have moved, and it got too difficult for me to go. Our cooperative will always remain, a reality that helps us, and we have a connection with them.

**A connection that still brings you to do concerts today.** Exactly. Practically, it is the cooperative that organizes with the different cooperatives in all of Italy, then they call us there and we go to do the shows.

**Before you told me that you’re searching for a sponsor, right?** Yes, we are searching for a sponsor that will help us for other shows, they are the most important thing to us. With the shows we can bring our voice and our themes around Italy; we are interested in this, not profit, really and truly.

**They’re non-profit shows so… Now you use only social media to advertise, right?** Yes exactly. Six months ago we made a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/scooppiati) page, and then we added [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/scooppiati/) . So please, follow us!

**I wanted to ask you just one last thing: when was the group started?** Scooppiati started around eleven years ago.

**So you’ve known your colleagues for many years…** Yeah well… quite a long time! We went to practically all of Italy, Termoli, Sora, they almost called us to Verona, we were in Sicily… I truly feel like a different person with them, because what we make with music is a very particular thing, it’s very interesting. It is our music, in the sense that it is totally written by us. Words and music, all ours. Now a new single is out called *Un istante,* that discusses war, but we’ve made other songs that cover other strong topics, like violence against women for example, other than disability, obviously.

**Daniele thank you for your time. Good luck for your next concerts!**
