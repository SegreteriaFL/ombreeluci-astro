**“But why would you want him to receive Communion? He can’t even tell a supermarket from a communion wafer.”**

These harsh words, said by a priest to the mother of an autistic boy, were shared in a comment by one of our readers—a religion teacher—under [an article from 1976](https://www.ombreeluci.it/1976/guidare-alla-luce-catechesi-sensoriale-per-una-vita-spirituale-inclusiva/) published in *Insieme* . A harsh judgment that ignores the ability of people with disabilities to live their faith authentically—even if with different tools and timelines. The teacher didn’t give up: she wants to create a **tactile book** designed for her student, because she rightly believes that every child can be guided on a spiritual journey.

**Ombre e Luci listens, collects, and shares** the experiences of those who live with disability, including in their life of faith—and of catechists and educators who strive every day to make faith accessible. Over the years, we’ve given space to many voices who, from different perspectives, have tried to **rethink [catechesis for everyone](https://www.ombreeluci.it/catechesi-e-disabilita/)** , including for those who communicate or understand differently.

Encouraged by that comment, we’ve begun a preliminary **search for practical resources** , both Italian and international, to offer an initial response to this commitment. What follows is the result: ready-to-use materials, tutorials for handmade tools, and initiatives for sensory and inclusive catechesis.

**If you know of other ideas, suggestions, projects, resources, or useful links, please write to us:** we’d be glad to gather and share them to enrich this shared map and make it available to those who need it.
