O
n June 14–15, the Jubilee of Sport will be celebrated. What better time to conclude the
*Padel Autism Tour*
? Paola Nicoletti, president of
[*Siamo Delfini – Impariamo l’Autismo*](https://www.ombreeluci.it/2024/benvenuti-al-sud/)
, tells us how the idea came to life.
**The association has organized a semi-professional padel tournament for two years, titled *Padel For Autism* .**
Each edition included a final moment where professional players shared the court with children and young adults from the association, introducing them to the basics of the game. That experience was so engaging it deserved to be repeated—this time more systematically—building a lasting connection between the world of padel and the world of autism. A key partner in this effort was
[*Athletica Vaticana*](https://www.ombreeluci.it/2023/se-io-diventa-noi/)
, its president, and especially Fabrizio Peloni, padel champion and secretary general of Vatican Padel for
*Athletica Vaticana*
.
[*Siamo Delfini – Impariamo l’Autismo*](https://www.ombreeluci.it/2024/una-prospettiva-degna-della-nostra-umanita/)
recruited padel coaches and athletes on a volunteer basis, along with around twenty children and teens eager to try the sport.
*Athletica Vaticana*
, in partnership with the Villa Pamphili Padel Club in Rome, identified clubs willing to offer courts for free to this beautifully diverse group. The response was overwhelming.
> Throughout this long journey, we’ve seen our children step onto the court with growing confidence and do what each of them is capable of doing

Across fourteen stops, matches and training sessions have taken place—and more are scheduled—where, as Nicoletti reminds us, “nobody wins, but everyone wins.”
**Padel demands attention to the other—a special challenge for people with autism, who often struggle with focus and interpersonal connection.**
Hitting the ball with the racket and getting it over the net is more than just satisfying—it encourages eye contact with the opponent. And that's where the spark of relationship begins. A beautiful spark. The coaches (Fabrizio Peloni, Gabriella and Marina Guglielmi, Paolo De Lellis, Daniele Lanuti) have learned to be gentle with the kids—not pushy, but persistent—because
**when that moment of connection comes, it’s deeply rewarding.**
During this long tour, we’ve witnessed our children becoming increasingly confident on court, doing what they each can: volleys, net shots, hugs and high fives for their coaches. Even collecting balls using those “magic tubes” becomes an exercise in focus and coordination—one that brings joy and calm. Unforgettable was Elisa’s entrance onto the court: a 13-year-old on the spectrum who, upon seeing everyone playing, joyfully called out: “Friends!” We’ve also seen 12- and 13-year-old players who, after finishing their own training, insisted on staying to help and teach the basics to older peers. Watching them have fun together, and seeing our children delighted to be among so many other young people, was truly moving. Gradually, volunteers and casual padel lovers who stumbled upon this team joined in—eager to help ensure each participant walked off the court with a small, meaningful step forward. We’re still at the beginning, but some are already rallying from the baseline, returning shots at the net, or simply learning to hold the racket with focus, ready for their opponent’s next move.
**Ending on June 14 will give hope to many children and families—to believe in the possibility of new, meaningful relationships.**
As often happens in these experiences, people from very different backgrounds come together and discover something unexpected—something new is born. And suddenly, it no longer matters who is helping and who is being helped. It becomes a precious exchange that enriches everyone: coaches, players, and spectators alike. Not bad at all—for two rackets, a net, and a ball. OL
