Good afternoon, my dear readers. In my [previous piece](https://www.ombreeluci.it/2025/che-bello-vedere-tanti-giovani/) , I mentioned that I would tell you how the trip to Pompei went. **Well, it went wonderfully!** Apart from a few hiccups that, in my opinion, could have been avoided — but all in all, everything turned out fine.

In Pompei, there were all the Italian communities and even some from abroad. What struck me most was seeing my very first community again — and watching young people working side by side with the Scouts, many of whom were discovering Fede e Luce for the first time. Another beautiful moment was during the pastry workshop, which I absolutely loved because — as those who know me well can confirm — I really enjoy cooking. Preparing desserts or savory dishes for everyone made me feel useful, like I was giving something of myself to all the communities, not just to those who already knew me.

But there was one thing that touched me deeply, as I also said in the testimony you can see below. I was there physically, but my heart was in Rome with our dear Pietro. **And forgive me if I tell you that this piece is dedicated to him,** because even though he wasn’t there in person, he was with us in spirit.

What else can I say? I’ll let the photos and videos speak for themselves, because — forgive me — some emotions simply can’t be put into words. Feelings can only be described up to a point, but the emotions I experienced during these days in Pompei — well, they have to be lived. They have to be lived because that’s how we grow. One of the most beautiful moments was seeing all the communities gathered together in the Sanctuary of Pompei during the Saturday evening vigil. **It was so meaningful, because Fede e Luce is founded on prayer — and seeing all those lights shining in the darkness was just breathtaking!** After all, our motto says it best: “It’s better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.” See you next time!
