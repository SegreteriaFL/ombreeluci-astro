**"My name is Francesca Pellegrini."**
I live in Montepulciano, in the province of Siena, Tuscany, with my dad, my mom, and my brother Tommaso, who's 22. I have Down syndrome—meaning I have three chromosomes in pair 21.
**I can’t stand it when people still treat me like a little girl.**
At 19, Francesca has a clear mind and many passions—above all, diving into stories. And, as you’ll see, never alone.
*When did your love for reading begin?*
I’ve always loved reading, ever since I learned how. It was something I could do by myself.
**And I love doing things on my own.**
My favorite books were fairy tales: *Cinderella*, *Snow White*, *Beauty and the Beast*, *Aladdin*, *Rapunzel*. In elementary school, my teachers had me retell them to the class. At home, I’d watch the DVDs and sing along to the soundtracks. I always asked for books with beautiful pictures—especially Disney books (I looked up how to spell “Disney” online!). When did you start reading to others? Every summer, we go to Follonica by the sea, to my grandparents’ house. I always bring books with me—even now that I’m older, I never go on vacation without packing some, even if we go somewhere else. At the beach, my grandmas would bring their grandkids under the umbrella, and I would gladly read stories to them, showing them the pictures as I went along.
*Have your reading tastes changed over time?*
As I grew up, my passion for reading didn’t fade—it actually grew stronger. I started enjoying short stories, novels, and school subjects like history. I even loved classics like *The Betrothed* and the *Divine Comedy*. With my educator Elena, I began buying simplified versions of classics with illustrations. Another big passion I discovered at school was mythology—my favorite stories are *The Odyssey*, *The Iliad*, and *The Aeneid*.
**I know them all really well.**
I’ve bought books like *The Big Book of Mythology*, *Greek Mythology*… and I’ve learned so many more ancient tales. Then I became fascinated by art and art history, especially the story of Lorenzo de’ Medici (Il Magnifico) and the monuments of Florence. Sometimes we take trips there to see the palaces, churches, and squares I’ve studied. I even visited Dante’s house—he’s one of my favorite authors. A few weeks ago, I bought a book about Catherine de’ Medici and did a research project on it with my friend Elisa (she’s a bit older than me, funny, very helpful, and we often go out together—for walks, shopping, and snacks).
> One day, the library director asked me if I wanted to take the course to become a Born to Read volunteer. In the end, about a year ago, I took the course with Elisa.

*What school did you attend?*
After middle school, I enrolled in the Liceo delle Scienze Umane (Human Sciences High School) to keep following my love for reading. After the pandemic, when we were free to go out again, I started leading reading workshops for kids. When I was 16, I took part in the “Read to Me” project at the Mago Burletto preschool in Montefollonico (Torrita di Siena). The teachers would invite people—including parents—to read to the children. I read two books that teacher Sabrina had given me a few days earlier, and at the end the children asked if I could come back the next day. I also read stories at Villa Simonelli in Chianciano Terme, with a teacher who organized reading labs for kids. And I read *Befana* stories at the Montepulciano town library—since it was January 5th, right before Epiphany. In summer 2023, I read every Tuesday morning to the children attending summer camps organized by the municipality of Montepulciano. Then, in my third year of high school, I began the PCTO program (it stands for "Paths for Transversal Skills and Orientation"—I looked it up online; it used to be called “School-Work Alternation,” which was easier for everyone to understand). I led more reading sessions in elementary schools and preschools.
**I loved reading—but also spending time with the children.**
*Do you choose the books yourself?*
Yes. I pick from the books I had as a child, or go with Elisa to the library. She or the staff there help me choose from the children’s section. When I turned 18, I also started choosing from the adult section—like the time I borrowed *Red Riding Hood: Blood Red*.
*How did you get involved with the “Born to Read” project?*
The library director, Francesca (we share the same name!), once asked if I’d like to join the volunteer training for *Born to Read* (NpL is the abbreviation). About a year ago, I took the course with Elisa. Now the library has a WhatsApp group with all of us who joined the program, and we organize reading workshops for schoolchildren, for kids in the hospital, or for events at the library. Last June, I graduated, and in the fall I started helping as an educator at the *Il Pollicino* nursery in Chianciano Terme. I often got sick working with little ones, so since January I’ve been going three times a week to the *Mago Burletto* preschool in Montefollonico, where teachers Sabrina, Mara, and Lina look after 28 kids. As soon as I arrive, I read to the children, then help out with their activities. The teachers are very kind to me, and the children too. Just a few days ago, we celebrated Carnival with songs, poems, dancing, and confetti.
**I had so much fun.**
Oh—and I almost forgot!
**Dancing is another big passion of mine.**
