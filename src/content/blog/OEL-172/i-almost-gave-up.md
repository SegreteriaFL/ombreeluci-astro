HHello again, my dear readers. Here I am! I already gave you a heads-up in my last piece that I’d soon share an update about the June 7th competition — and here it is: third medal, and once again, first place.

This medal means even more to me than the previous two. It’s the confirmation I didn’t know I needed — because this year, swimming hasn’t been smooth sailing. It’s been a real ride, full of ups and downs. But the real breakthrough came as the race got closer. That’s when I knew: I wasn’t ready to quit.

Because yes — I’ll admit it — I almost gave up. But then I paused, took a breath, and unplugged.

As you may have noticed, I disappeared for a while. I didn’t write, didn’t check in. I needed to shut out everything and everyone in order to figure out what I really wanted. And what I realized was this: If I had walked away, it would’ve felt like letting my disability win. Again. And I said no — not this time.

There are so many dreams I’ve had to tuck away in a drawer, dreams I’ll never get to open. But this one—this is mine. And I know deep down that I have to keep going.

As I always say — and I’ll keep saying it — I couldn’t have done this without the incredible support of Enrico Testa and Monica, my very first coach. It feels only right to thank those who made it possible for this dream to slowly come true. Without them, I wouldn’t be here today sharing my story — and showing you that yes, we can do it, disability or not.

So here it is, officially: for the third year in a row, I’ve brought home the gold—first place again in the 25-meter backstroke. What can I say? Never underestimate yourself.

And there’s more — some exciting news on the way! But I’m waiting on a few things before I can share them with you. Last year — remember? — I told you I had two back-to-back competitions. This year I’ve done one so far… but the other? You’ll have to wait a little longer.

Yep, stay tuned — because life still has plenty of beautiful surprises in store for us.
