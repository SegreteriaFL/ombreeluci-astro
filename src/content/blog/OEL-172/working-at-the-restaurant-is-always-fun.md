Ilike working as a waitress and doing other things at the restaurant. But when I’m on holiday in Castiglione della Pescaia, I’m really on holiday. **Still, sometimes I’m very happy to help my friends at the seaside restaurants.** But here’s the important part: I absolutely don’t want to be paid. I do it because I’m a friend, and because it feels like an internship. With no money involved.

I wash the glasses and put them away. Then I set up the cutlery—the fork and the knife—inside the napkin, so everything is ready for the table to be set properly. I really enjoy doing it and have fun. At home too, I wash the dishes, glasses, and cutlery. Even the pots. Then I dry them and put them back in place. Where I work, at “Merè” in Rome, there’s also a dishwasher because there are so many things to wash. At home, it’s just a few.

**I’ve learned that the more I work, the more I improve. The better and faster I do things, the more I learn. I always watch others too, to see how they do things.** When I was at school, I had fun and felt good because of my classmates. I really enjoyed being with them and also with the teachers. But I think working is better—it’s much more fun.

The best part is the colleagues, because you become friends and share lots of laughs. That’s why working is always fun. **If you’re alone, it’s not nice.** I also like it because you need to do things properly, since everything matters. Even setting the table well is very important. You always have to learn how to do it right.

I also enjoy working because so many people come to eat. That way, I get to know everyone and become friends with them. I love this, because we talk and everyone is happy to be together. Sometimes there are people who come back again and again—especially for lunch in Rome, but also in Castiglione della Pescaia. I like going back to the same restaurant too, because **I feel good there.** But sometimes I also change, because I like discovering new and different places.
