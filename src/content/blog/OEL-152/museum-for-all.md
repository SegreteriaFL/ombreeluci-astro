One of the characteristics that noticeably burdens a person’s condition of disability is the **reduced possibility of interacting with the environment** , of **moving freely** in it, of **getting to know it** . We know how important it is for a child, any child, to be able to move around to get to know and learn. The **Ability association Onlus** of Milan reminds us of this with many of its initiatives for children with serious disabilities. The main objective of this association – born in 1988 by some parents and administrators in response to the lack of references that left families alone – was precisely to **promote the growth of children** in this condition, **defend their rights** and **support their families** . In our country, the dominant perspective with which we look at disability is often still linked to the **medical condition alone** , neglecting the importance of the **environment and sociality** in which we live. At The Ability we work to **facilitate these interactions and relationships** in every possible context of life, dealing not only with therapy or school settings and architectural barriers in cities, but **opening our gaze to public spaces** .

This is how it was born **Museum for All** , launched with the **De Agostini Foundation** , so that **places of culture were accessible** not only physically but also cognitively to a public that, until then, had been excluded. The possibility of facilitating access to those with intellectual disabilities took shape in 2014 with the pilot project of the **Leonardo da Vinci National Museum of Science and Technology** in Milan. **“Scienzabile – inclusion and game between science and disability”** represented a new way to live the museum experience: **tailored materials** , **specific visits** to the collections and **inclusive lab activities** , with the idea that everyone has different skills that need to be enhanced in a context of cooperation. Since then, the idea has spread to other institutions, allowing the public to experience **inclusive museum visits** , to perceive the **beauty of cultural heritage** , to **understand it** because it is thoroughly explained, to **internalize it** because it is lived on a **cognitive and emotional level** .

The **Museum for All project** is structured in a **three-phase path** : **context analysis** , **training** , and **structuring of the visit** . In the first phase, a **working group** composed of experts in cultural heritage and accessibility, and professionals in the psychopedagogical field, analyze the peculiarities of each participating museum. In the second, together with the museum staff, an **innovative training and co-design program** is developed: the **quality of human interaction** with the staff is essential for a serene and fruitful visit. Finally, the phase involves the creation of **essential tools to ensure an enjoyable and accessible visit** , including **specific routes and easy-to-read guides** . These are already active in museums such as **Beni FAI** , **Palazzo Altemps** , **Villa Gregoriana** in Rome, **Museum of the Innocents** in Florence, **Venaria Reale** in Turin, and others listed on the [labilita.org](https://labilita.org) website.

In short, all that remains is to **cross the threshold** of these places that, as **cultural and artistic heritage** , truly contribute to making us a community. **No one excluded** .
